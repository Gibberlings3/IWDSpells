@101="Chant
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 2
Sphere: Combat
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 60-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

By means of the Chant spell, the priest brings special favor upon <PRO_HIMHER>self and <PRO_HISHER> party and causes harm to <PRO_HISHER> enemies. When the Chant spell is completed, all the priest's allies within the area of effect gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls, minimum damage rolls, and Saving Throws. Furthermore, damage dice for all effects outside a weapon's base damage is reduced by 1. For example, a 6d6 fireball will do 6d5 damage, and a flaming long sword that deals 1d8+2 slashing plus 1d3 fire damage will deal 1d8+2 slashing plus 1d2 fire damage instead. The priest's enemies suffer from the opposite effects.

Multiple chants are not cumulative. This spell requires a moderate amount of concentration by the caster, so <PRO_HISHER> movement is slowed by half."

Symbol, Pain is a powerful enchantment that allows the priest to inscribe a symbol on the ground or any other surface. The symbol will remain there until someone comes too close, at which point it will explode, causing all those within the area of effect to make a Saving Throw vs. Spell. Those who fail their Saving Throws are overwhelmed by pain, suffering a -4 penalty to their attack rolls, a -2 penalty to their Dexterity scores, and a -2 penalty to their Armor Class.~
