# IWDSpells

## Overview

IWDSpells is a tool to bring the new spells and bard songs from Icewind Dale into the Baldur's Gate series of games. While it can be used as a standalone mod, it's primarily intended as a tool for modmakers to include in their own mods; this readme assumes that you are a modmaker and are familiar with WEIDU mods. (If you are not a modder and just want the IWD spells, it's probably simpler to use the IWDification mod.)

A lot of this project is based upon the work of the discontinued IWD-in-BG2 conversion project, which later formed the backbone of IWDEE.

Please report any bugs on the forums so that they can be addressed.
